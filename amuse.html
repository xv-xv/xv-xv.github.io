        <h1>Amusing Internet Pages</h1>
        <p>The internet has some hidden gems and being as chronically online as I am here are some links to content that make me giggle and stare in awe sometimes.</p>

        <h2>Impractical Jokers</h2>
        <p>This first one is a clip from one of my favorite television shows, Impractical Jokers. The whole point of this show is that there's these four best friends that have known each other since high school who give each other dares. The person that loses at the end of each episode has to do the punishment, no questions asked. I linked a clip that makes me laugh everytime I watch it.</p>

        <h2>Di<em>WHY?</em></h2>
        <p>Reddit has been on the internet since the dawn of time it feels like. This subreddit focuses on the questionable solutions that people make. Every so often I like to go through the posts and gander upon some interesting sights, scroll with caution.</p>

        <h2>Zoomquilt</h2>
        <p>This website has animations that seem to continue on forever. It's one of those things that make you lose track of time because you're always wondering what comes next in the painting.</p>
