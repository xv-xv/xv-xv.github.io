        <p>Dr. Ellen Ochoa is a <strong>veteran astronaut</strong> who became the first woman to fly to space back in 1993. She provides future generations with the hope and drive to work towards their passions.</p>
        <p>Before starting her flight training in 1991, Dr. Ochoa was rejected for the program twice. There's this part of success where the struggles are hidden behind the scenes. She studied for years and paved the way for so many more Latina astronauts.</p>
